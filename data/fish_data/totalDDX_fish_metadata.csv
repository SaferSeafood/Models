CompositeCommonName,Common name for each fish species
CompositeTissuePrep,How composite tissue was prepared for analysis 
NumberFishPerComp,Number of fish that were pooled for a composite 
CompositeTissueName,Tissue type. Whether whole fish or fillets were used. 
WeightAvg.g,Average weight of each fish within a composite

Year,Year of collection for each composite.
